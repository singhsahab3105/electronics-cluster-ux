# City-Based Cluster + Marketplace Platform
UX Case Study for Electronics Hardware Startups

## Problem Understanding

Electronics hardware startups struggle to move from idea to execution
because they lack clarity on team composition, trusted talent,
coordination models, and realistic timelines.

Unlike software, hardware execution requires tight collaboration
between embedded, PCB, mechanical, and QA roles—often within the same city.

This platform focuses on reducing execution risk rather than
simply listing freelancers.

## Solution Overview

The proposed platform helps founders assemble execution-ready
teams or clusters within their city.

Instead of a free-for-all marketplace, the system:
- Recommends engagement models
- Limits choices
- Emphasizes trust signals
- Enables commitment without forcing payment

## User Journey & Information Architecture

User Flow:
Landing → City Selection → Engagement Recommendation →
Cluster/Freelancer Comparison → Trust Validation → Commitment

Information Architecture:
- Home
- Cities
- How It Works
- Profiles
- Request Proposal

## Microcopy Examples

City Selection:
"Local teams mean faster iterations and real accountability."

Cluster Explanation:
"Clusters provide a single execution owner, reducing coordination risk."

Trust Disclaimer:
"All profiles are manually vetted and verified through past work."

Empty State:
"No teams available in this city currently. We’ll notify you."

Error State:
"We couldn’t clearly match your needs. Let us help refine them."

## Key UX Decisions

1. Recommendation Before Browsing  
   Founders lack clarity; guidance reduces anxiety.

2. City-First Navigation  
   Hardware execution depends heavily on geography.

3. Commitment Without Payment  
   High-trust decisions should not feel transactional.

## Wireframes Overview

Low-fidelity wireframes were created to focus on
user flow, trust-building, and decision clarity
rather than visual design.

The screens demonstrate how a founder moves from
initial intent to a confident commitment without
being forced into a transaction.

## Wireframe Fidelity Note

The wireframes are intentionally kept low-fidelity
to highlight UX thinking and flow decisions.
Visual polish and UI styling were not the focus
of this exercise.

## Personal Observation

This approach is based on observing that early-stage
hardware founders struggle more with coordination
and accountability than with finding individual skills.
